# Redefine PNG_ZLIB_VERNUM from a real one to zero (that's also how it used to be)
# to avoid all checks for this version in sources,
# since Android and other plaforms use different versions of zlib for now
# (r10e ndk includes zlib 1.2.3, other platforms use 1.2.8)
# TODO: Check if there is any performance difference on non-Android platforms
@# define PNG_ZLIB_VERNUM 0
