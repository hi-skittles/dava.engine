	\page page_introduction Introduction

	Our SDK is one of the solutions that can help you to develop good games for big variety of platforms. 
	Main idea is easy cross-platform and cross-device game development.
	
	SDK is C/C++ based because of the following reasons: 
	<ul>
		<li>C/C++ available on almost every good platform</li>
		<li>Best performance for mobile platforms</li>
		<li>Tons of good existing libraries available for C/C++</li>
	</ul>
 
	\subsection sub_platforms Supported platforms / devices
	<ul>
		<li>Windows. Windows XP, Windows 7.</li>
		<li>Mac OS X 10.5+</li>
		<li>iOS 3.0+</li>
	</ul>
 
	\section target_audience Target audience
	DAVA SDK will be the best solution if your initial target platforms is iOS / Android / Mac OS X and PC. It will be good
	for casual game developers, indie game developers and all other developers who target their product to these platforms. 
	
	You can save your time on combining everything you need and just start work on the game logic immediatelly.

/**
	\page page_getting_started Getting started / SDK Basics
	Recommended directory structure to avoid problems with multiple revisions of the framework:
	<p>
		Projects for each version of the framework should lie on the same level as framework itself. 
		Projects for v.1.0 of the framework.	
		<br/>
		~/user/projects/v10/dava.framework<br/>
		~/user/projects/v10/project1<br/>
		~/user/projects/v10/project2<br/>
		~/user/projects/v10/project3<br/>

		Projects for v.2.0 of the framework. 
		<br/>
		~/user/projects/v20/dava.framework<br/>
		~/user/projects/v20/project1<br/>
		~/user/projects/v20/project2<br/>
		~/user/projects/v20/project3<br/>
 
		<b>Why you should keep multiple revisions of the framework?</b> <br/>
		Normally it's not required. You can always switch to newest and you can get benifits from that. 
		But sometimes when your project is on final stage of development it's no make any sense to transfer it to new framework and pass whole 
		QA cycle again. So for such purposes you should keep all versions of the framework you actually need. 
 	</p>
	\section projdirstruct Project directory structure
	When you start your project you should think carefully about the directory structure.
	SDK propose you the following directory structure
	~/project_home/Classes - your source code for this specific project<br/>

/**
	\page page_framework_architecture Application Architecture

	List of sections:
	- \ref how_to_start
	- \ref how_to_create
	- \ref ui_first_steps
	- \ref ui_event_handling
	- \ref firstgameobject
	
	\section how_to_start How to start development
	To start your own project you can copy Template Project and start writing the code. 
	
	Template project have the following files and folders:
	- Classes
		- FrameworkMain.cpp - functions that performed at framework launch and framework quit.
		- GameCore.cpp - implementation of ApplicationCore delegate 
		- GameCore.h - declaration of ApplicationCore delegate
		- FirstScreen.cpp - implementation of sample screen 
		- FirstScreen.h - declaration of sample screen
	- Data - directory for compiled resources (empty at the beginning)
	- DataSource - directory for resources that is not compiled 
		- convert_graphics.py - helper script to perform packing of graphics
		- Gfx
	
	Next section will describe how to create application manually and how FrameworkMain.cpp, GameCore.cpp and GameCore.h organized.  
 
	\section how_to_create How to create application
	To create your own application you need to perform the following steps:

	1. Create FrameworkMain.cpp and define FrameworkDidLaunched and FrameworkWillTerminate functions
	\code
	void FrameworkDidLaunched()
	{
		//	Create keyed archive for application options
		KeyedArchive * appOptions = new KeyedArchive();
		#if defined(__DAVAENGINE_IPHONE__)
		// set application base orientation (should be the same as in Info.plist)
		appOptions->SetInt("orientation", Core::SCREEN_ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT);

		// set virtual resolution you want to work in
		DAVA::Core::Instance()->SetVirtualScreenSize(320, 480);

		// register resources and their resolutions
		DAVA::Core::Instance()->RegisterAvailableResourceSize(320, 480, "Gfx");
		#else
		// set client area size for the windowed application
		appOptions->SetInt("width",	920);
		appOptions->SetInt("height", 690);

		appOptions->SetInt("fullscreen.width",	1024);
		appOptions->SetInt("fullscreen.height", 768);

		// this flag means that we start from windowed mode
		appOptions->SetInt("fullscreen", 0);

		// 32 bits per pixel
		appOptions->SetInt("bpp", 32); 

		DAVA::Core::Instance()->SetVirtualScreenSize(920, 690);
		DAVA::Core::Instance()->RegisterAvailableResourceSize(920, 690, "Gfx");
		#endif 

		// create our class that inherited from ApplicationCore
		GameCore * core = new GameCore();
		// set it as application core
		DAVA::Core::SetApplicationCore(core);
		// set launch options
		DAVA::Core::SetOptions(appOptions);
	}

	void FrameworkWillTerminate()
	{


	}
	\endcode

	2. Implement all virtual functions of ApplicationCore
	\code
	void GameCore::OnAppStarted()
	{
		Renderer::SetDesiredFPS(30);

		mainMenuScreen.Set(new MainMenuScreen());
		gameScreen.Set(new GameScreen());
		winScreen = newref(WinScreen);

        
		GetEngineContext()->uiScreenManager->RegisterScreen(SCREEN_MAIN_MENU, mainMenuScreen.Get());
		GetEngineContext()->uiScreenManager->RegisterScreen(SCREEN_GAME, gameScreen.Get());
		GetEngineContext()->uiScreenManager->RegisterScreen(SCREEN_WIN, winScreen.Get());

		GetEngineContext()->uiScreenManager->SetFirst(SCREEN_GAME);
	}

	void GameCore::OnAppFinished()
	{
	// Release RefPtr pointers to avoid memory leaks
		mainMenuScreen = 0;
		gameScreen = 0;
	}

	void GameCore::OnSuspend()
	{
	}

	void GameCore::OnResume()
	{
	}

	void GameCore::OnBackground()
	{
	}

	void GameCore::BeginFrame()
	{
		ApplicationCore::BeginFrame();
		RenderManager::Instance()->ClearWithColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
	}

	void GameCore::Update(float32 timeElapsed)
	{	
		ApplicationCore::Update(timeElapsed);
	}

	void GameCore::Draw()
	{
		ApplicationCore::Draw();
	}
	\endcode
 
	\section ui_first_steps UI Introduction
 
	Here we'll describe how to create first UIScreen and create several controls inside. 
	
	\section ui_event_handling UI Event Handling 

	Here we'll describe how to handle events and use messages in our SDK.

/**
	\page page_tutorial_packer Packer Tutorial

    \section sprites Sprites
    <p>
        To tell you about packer firstly I want to say few words about Sprites. 
        
        Sprite is low level rendering object that is used for biggest part of 2D graphics in our engine.
        Idea is pretty simple, Sprite is 2D image with different properties. 
        Our sprite has the following properties: position, scale, rotation, pivot point and frame.
        
        Example of sprite usage:
        \code
// in UIScreen::LoadResources
Sprite * sprite = Sprite::Create("~res:/Gfx/Menu/header");
 
// in Draw function
sprite->SetPosition(x, y);
sprite->SetAngle(DegToRad(30.0f));
sprite->Draw();
 
// in UIScreen::UnloadResources
SafeRelease(sprite);
        \endcode

        Sprites can have multiple frames. It can be very usefull in many situations. For the UI you can keep different states of the same element inside one sprite.
        In Game logic you can keep animations or different parts of the same object inside one sprite. 
        Typical cases of sprite usage: 2d animations, UI elements with same size but different states, complex game objects that have different sub-objects.

        To use Sprites you should prepare them first using ResourcePacker utility. It's available for Windows and MacOS X and written on SDK as well.
    </p>
    
    \section how_to How to use packer
    <p>
        After copying Framework template project you should have everything to start work with packer. 
        Each DataSource directory is equiped with script convert_graphics.py. This script allows you to run packer easily. 
        If you want to see all logs you should open terminal or console, find DataSource directory and run convert_graphics.py.
    </p>
    <p>
        convert_graphics.py automatically finds all subfolders with Gfx prefix inside DataSource directory and pack them to corresponding Data directory. 
        Corresponding Data directory lies on the same level with DataSource directory.
    </p>
    
    \section supported_formats Supported formats and packing rules
    <p>
        ResourcePacker support 2 formats: PNG and PSD. 
        
        Conversion rules for PSD: Packer unpack every frame of PSD file and use it as sprite frame. So if you have running character with all frames in PSD format after conversion 
        you'll have 1 sprite with all frames.
        
        Conversion rules for PNG: Packer open .pngdef file first and read number of frames in your sequence. According to the number of frames it split your PNG image and
        create 1 sprite with requested number of frames. Now supports only vertically packed images. 
        
    </p>
    \section how_it_works How ResourcePacker works
    <p>
        Let's say we have Game subfolder inside Gfx folder and 2 PSD sprites in this folder: soldier.psd and bullets.psd. 
        soldier.psd contain all frames required for soldier animation and bullets.psd contains all bullets for the game.
        
        1)First of all packer split every PSD file into frames.<br/>
        2)Then packer removes all unused space around each frame and try to pack them into 1 texture <br/>
        3)If it's possible to pack everything into one texture packer finish with this folder and moves to next folder <br/>
    
        Generally this is very simple explanation on how ResourcePacker works. 
    </p>

	\section convert_graphics convert_graphics.py
	
	This file is helper file for packer executable. This script use relative path to framework, so if script do not working you 
	should check is path is right.
 
	\code
# *************** HERE YOU SHOULD SETUP YOUR OWN PATHS ***************
# Darwin - MacOS Path
# Windows - Windows Path
framework_path = { "Darwin": "./../dava.framework", "Windows": "./../dava.framework" }
# *************** HERE YOU SHOULD SETUP YOUR OWN PATHS ***************
	\endcode
 
 
	\section packerflags Flags

	Every directory inside Gfx folder can contain flags.txt file. Using this file you can change packing options for this particular directory. 
	\code
--pvr - pack textures in this folder to pvr format
--tsize4096 - set max texture size to 4096
--add0pixel - set 0 pixels default space between sprite frames
--add1pixel - set 1 pixels default space between sprite frames
--add2pixel - set 2 pixels default space between sprite frames
--add3pixel - set 3 pixels default space between sprite frames
default value is 1
--debug - draw debug rects around frames
--split - every PSD in directory will be packed to own texture
--rebuild_this -- пересобирает только этот каталог
	\endcode
 
    <!-- 
	Notes:
        
        There are 3 main use cases:
        1) You 
        
        Sounds very simple but on practice there are few other options available.
        

    1) If your pack paths is different for example /DataSource/Gfx and /datasource/gfx packer will perform repack, so be carefull and use case-sentensive paths in all cases.
